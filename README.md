# Introduction

This repository is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples of scripting for the [Jenkins Pipeline plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

# Layout

The repository is broken up into four directories currently:

* *pipeline-examples* - for general Pipeline examples.
* *global-library-examples* - for examples of how to write and use the global library on a Jenkins master.
* *jenkinsfile-examples* - for examples of using `Jenkinsfile`s checked into repositories.
* *docs* - for documentation, guides and other non-code content.

Please put your script into its own directory under the appropriate directory above, with a README.md file included explaining what your script does or shows. Make sure your script is commented so that others can understand how it works, why it works, etc.
